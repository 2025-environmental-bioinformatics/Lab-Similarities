# ðŸ”¬ Searching for Similar Sequences

In bioinformatics, one of the most common tasks is to search for similar sequencesâ€”to identify genes or proteins that share evolutionary ancestry, structural motifs, or functional roles. Sequence similarity searches allow us to annotate unknown sequences, discover homologs across species, and detect conserved domains that hint at biological function. Two of the most widely used tools for this are BLAST, which rapidly finds close matches in sequence databases, and HMMER, which uses profile hidden Markov models to sensitively detect more distant relationships.
